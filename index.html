                <h2>Show Summary</h2>
                <p><em>Invincible</em> is an animated superhero series based on the comic book by Robert Kirkman. The
                    show
                    follows Mark Grayson. a seemingly ordinary high school student, who discovers that he has inherited
                    superhuman abilities from his father, Omni-Man. As Mark begins his journey as the hero Invincible,
                    he
                    quickly learns that the world of superheroes is far more complex and dangerous than he ever
                    imagined.
                    <br><br>
                    While his father, Omni-man, is considered one of the Earth's most powerful heroes, Mark's path
                    is filled with moral dilemmas, epic battles, and shocking truths about his family's dark legacy. As
                    the
                    series progresses, Mark uncovers a devastating revelation about his father's true mission on Earth â€”
                    to
                    conquer the planet for the Viltrumite Empire.
                    <br><br>
                    With action-packed sequences, emotional character
                    development, and unexpected twists, <em>Invincible</em> is a brutal and mature take on the superhero
                    genre. The show explores themes of power, responsibility, family, and the cost of being a hero, all
                    while navigating Mark's transition from a teenager trying to live a normal life to a superhero
                    facing
                    impossible choices.
