            <h2>Show Summary</h2>
            <p><em>Invincible</em> is an animated superhero series based on the comic book by Robert Kirkman. The show
                follows Mark Grayson. a seemingly ordinary high school student, who discovers that he has inherited
                superhuman abilities from his father, Omni-Man. As Mark begins his journey as the hero Invincible, he
                quickly learns that the world of superheroes is far more complex and dangerous than he ever imagined.
                <br><br>
                While his father, Omni-man, is considered one of the Earth's most powerful heroes, Mark's path
                is filled with moral dilemmas, epic battles, and shocking truths about his family's dark legacy. As the
                series progresses, Mark uncovers a devastating revelation about his father's true mission on Earth â€” to
                conquer the planet for the Viltrumite Empire.
                <br><br>
                With action-packed sequences, emotional character
                development, and unexpected twists, <em>Invincible</em> is a brutal and mature take on the superhero
                genre. The show explores themes of power, responsibility, family, and the cost of being a hero, all
                while navigating Mark's transition from a teenager trying to live a normal life to a superhero facing
                impossible choices.
