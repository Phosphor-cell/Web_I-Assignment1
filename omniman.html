                <p><h4>Background</h4><br>

                    Omni-Man, born as Nolan Grayson, is a high-ranking member of the Viltrumite Empire, an alien race known for their incredible strength, near-immortality, and ruthless conquest of planets. Sent to Earth under the pretense of protecting it, Nolan built a life as a devoted husband to Debbie Grayson and father to Mark Grayson, who would later become the hero Invincible. For years, he posed as Earth’s greatest protector, using his charisma and strength to establish himself as one of the most respected superheroes. <br>However, his true purpose was far darker—his mission was to weaken Earth in preparation for Viltrumite domination. When the time came to reveal his allegiance, he ruthlessly slaughtered the Guardians of the Globe, shocking the world and setting the stage for an emotional and brutal confrontation with his son.<br>


                <h4>Current Situation</h4><br>

                    After his devastating battle with Invincible, Nolan left Earth, questioning the Viltrumite way and his own role in it. <br>Though he was once fully devoted to the empire’s ideology of strength and conquest, his bond with his family, especially Mark, has caused him to struggle with his loyalty.<br> As the Viltrumite threat looms larger, Nolan finds himself caught between duty and personal redemption.<br>Whether he will remain a conqueror or defy his own kind for the sake of his son and the people he once sought to subjugate remains one of the most compelling arcs in Invincible.<br>
                <h4>Abilities & Powers</h4><br>

                    Omni-Man possesses the extraordinary abilities inherent to all Viltrumites, making him one of the most powerful beings in the universe.<br>

                    Flight – He can soar through the skies and even travel through space at incredible speeds.<br>
                    Adaptiveness – With a warrior’s mind, he quickly adjusts to new environments, combat styles, and tactics.<br>
                    Nigh-Invulnerability – His body is nearly indestructible, allowing him to withstand explosions, extreme temperatures, and intense physical trauma.<br>
                    Super Healing – While not completely invincible, his regenerative abilities allow him to recover rapidly from injuries that would be fatal to others.<br>
                    Super Lung Capacity – Capable of holding his breath for extended periods, he can survive in space and underwater without issue.<br>
                    Super Speed – His reflexes and movement speed far surpass those of humans, making him a deadly force in battle.<br>
                    Super Strength – His raw power enables him to level cities, defeat entire armies, and take on multiple super-powered opponents at once.<br>
                    Hand-to-Hand Combat – As a seasoned Viltrumite warrior, he is a master of unarmed combat, capable of overwhelming opponents through both brute strength and tactical skill.<br>

                    Omni-Man is more than just a superpowered being—he is a living weapon of the Viltrumite Empire, torn between his duty to conquer and his love for his family. His journey from hero to villain—and possibly back again—makes him one of the most fascinating and feared characters in the Invincible universe.</p>
