                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Omni-Man, born as Nolan Grayson, is a high-ranking member of the Viltrumite Empire, an alien
                        race
                        known for their incredible strength, near-immortality, and ruthless conquest of planets. Sent to
                        Earth under the pretense of protecting it, Nolan built a life as a devoted husband to Debbie
                        Grayson
                        and father to Mark Grayson, who would later become the hero Invincible. For years, he posed as
                        Earth's greatest protector, using his charisma and strength to establish himself as one of the
                        most
                        respected superheroes. </p>
                    <p>However, his true purpose was far darker—his mission was to weaken Earth
                        in preparation for Viltrumite domination. When the time came to reveal his allegiance, he
                        ruthlessly
                        slaughtered the Guardians of the Globe, shocking the world and setting the stage for an
                        emotional
                        and brutal confrontation with his son.</p>

                    <h2>Current Situation</h2>
                    <p>
                        After his devastating battle with Invincible, Nolan left Earth, questioning the Viltrumite way
                        and
                        his own role in it. Though he was once fully devoted to the empire’s ideology of strength and
                        conquest, his bond with his family, especially Mark, has caused him to struggle with his
                        loyalty. As the Viltrumite threat looms larger, Nolan finds himself caught between duty and
                        personal redemption. Whether he will remain a conqueror or defy his own kind for the sake of his
                        son and the people he once sought to subjugate remains one of the most compelling arcs in
                        Invincible.</p>

                    Omni-Man is more than just a superpowered being—he is a living weapon of the Viltrumite Empire, torn
                    between his duty to conquer and his love for his family. His journey from hero to villain—and
                    possibly back again—makes him one of the most fascinating and feared characters in the Invincible
                    universe.
